Hands-on experience with GitHub-based collaboration workflows, including repository forking, feature branch development, pull request creation, and safe rollback using git revert. Comfortable working entirely via the command line, authenticating with GitHub Personal Access Tokens, and validating repository and pull request metadata through the GitHub REST API.

Getting Started with Git and GitHub – Practical Labs

* Forked repositories and managed independent development workflows using feature branches

* Created, committed, and pushed changes using Git CLI following GitHub best practices

* Merged feature branches into main and validated merge results via terminal output

* Reverted commits using git revert to safely undo changes while preserving commit history

* Authenticated Git operations using GitHub Personal Access Tokens instead of passwords

* Created and managed pull requests from forked repositories to upstream projects

* Verified pull request metadata using the GitHub REST API (curl, jq)

* Inspected branch status and divergence using git branch -vv, git status, and git log

* Worked in a cloud-based GitHub-compatible IDE, demonstrating CLI-first workflows

## Simple Interest Calculator

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

```
Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
